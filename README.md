## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a personal log entry from a crew member of Station Ariadne, describing the first subtle, inexplicable system anomaly they notice.
- Create a scene where Leo interviews a surviving family member of an Ariadne crew member, trying to understand the person behind the data.
- Write Mira's perspective on Leo's obsession with the Ariadne feeds, as she sees him becoming consumed by the 'unedited present'.
- Draft a 'sensory memoir' fragment that Leo is working on concurrently with the Ariadne project, highlighting the contrast between curated past and chaotic present.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for Leo's documentary editing console, visualizing how he navigates and 'stitches' together terabytes of multi-format sensor and log data.
- Propose a system architecture for the Ariadne Station's 'redundant' systems, and diagram how a 'cascading fault' might silently propagate through it.
